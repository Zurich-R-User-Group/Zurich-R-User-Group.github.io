title: "Open Data Day Hackathon"
---

Can you imagine ways to improve public transport in your city? Do you know or wish to learn how to wrangle, analyse, visualize or communicate with data? Join our upcoming hackathon in Zürich, meet people from the open data community - and let's make an impact together on all the ways we get around!

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library("ggmap")
zrh <- get_map(location = "Zurich", zoom = 12, source="stamen", maptype="toner")
ggmap(zrh)
```


Together with 
[Open Data Zurich](https://data.stadt-zuerich.ch/),
[VBZ](https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/vbz/en/index.html) and [Opendata.ch](http://opendata.ch), 
the [Zürich R Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-R-User-Group/messages/boards/) is 
planning to hold a hackathon on occasion of

**[Open Data Day](http://opendataday.org/) - Saturday, March 4, 2017**.

The event will include time for hacking but we will also invite some speakers
for talks. Food and drinks will be provided. All you have to bring is your
laptop.

You do not need to be a data science superhero yet. It is completely fine if you 
have basic skills in **one** of the following:

- Combining and cleaning data sets
- Creating graphs and visualisations
- Creating statistics or models
- Creating slides, documents, websites or anything else to communicate the results

For analysis you can use *any open data* you like. VBZ provides *transport delay* 
and *passenger count* data via the [Zurich Open Data Portal](https://data.stadt-zuerich.ch/dataset?sort=score+desc%2C+metadata_modified+desc&tags=vbz). The goal is it to
use open source software (such as from [R Project](https://www.r-project.org/)) to 
get interesting new insights and share them with the world. 

More details to follow - please join the [Zürich R Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-R-User-Group/messages/boards/) to get announcements, and stay tuned!
