title: "Who we are"
---

We are R Users from in and around Zurich. We hold Meetups, which you can see 
[here](http://www.meetup.com/Zurich-R-User-Group/).

Currently [Dorothea Hug Peter, Muriel Buri, Andrea Schnell, Kirill MÃ¼ller, Johannes Bracher and Rachel Heyard](http://www.meetup.com/Zurich-R-User-Group/members/?op=leaders) 
are the organisers.

The source code for the website can be found [here](https://github.com/Zurich-R-User-Group/Zurich-R-User-Group.github.io). 
If you want parts of the website changed, just make a pull request or file an
[issue](https://github.com/Zurich-R-User-Group/Zurich-R-User-Group.github.io/issues).
The website is based on [RMarkdown website examples](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown-website-examples)
and was quite easy to publish thanks to [github pages](https://pages.github.com/).
